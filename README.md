This project is a backend API built with FastAPI and SQLite for managing electronics product data. It provides endpoints to list products (/step1), filter by release date (/step2), filter by brands (/step3), paginate results (/step4), merge product and brand data (/step5), fetch data from the database (/step6), and perform CRUD operations (/step7). It supports fetching data from external APIs or a local JSON file, handles invalid or malformed data gracefully, and ensures proper filtering, pagination, and data validation. The project can be run locally using uvicorn main:app --reload with optional environment variables for API URLs, local JSON path, and database connection. API documentation is available at /docs, and all endpoints return JSON responses following a consistent structure.
